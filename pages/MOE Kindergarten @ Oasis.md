<p style="font-size: 20px;font-family: Lato,sans-serif;text-align:justify;">At MOE Kindergarten@Oasis, we carry out “Weeks of Wonder” (WoW) projects to provide opportunities for children to use their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) in an immersive and authentic context. Guided by the steps: “I Wonder”, “I Find Out” and “I Know”, children engage in collaborative and self-directed learning experiences as they work together to investigate topics that interest them. To record the learning process and our children’s growth in the language, each project culminates in sharing at such platforms as an exhibition, newsletter and video presentation. These sharing platforms give parents a springboard for conversations with their children in their Mother Tongue so as to nurture a love for MTL at home. </p>
