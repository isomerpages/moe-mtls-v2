	The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) is an annual event co-organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC). It is an annual event that aims to promote our MTLs by showcasing good practices and efforts by both schools and the community in the teaching and learning of our respective MTLs. It primarily targets MTL educators from the pre-schools to lower primary levels and parents with young children.

The theme of this year’s MTLS is “Flourish in the Wonderland of Our Languages,” and the symposium will be held on Saturday, 26 August 2023, at the Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre. The symposium will return to a full face-to-face format since the COVID-19 pandemic.
