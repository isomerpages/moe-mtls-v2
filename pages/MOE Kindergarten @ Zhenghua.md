<p style="font-size: 20px;font-family: Lato,sans-serif;text-align:justify;">At MOE Kindergarten @ Zhenghua, we believe that children learn best through fun, and creative and meaningful experiences. We activate each child’s voice, agency, and creativity through our centre-based programme, “Artsy Friday”. This programme exposes children to different forms of art whilst they learn about Singapore’s unique culture.&nbsp;<br>
Each term, the children decide on an art form to focus on, and then begin to learn about, and develop an appreciation for the local ethnic culture through the chosen art form. During this process, they have the opportunity to communicate in their mother tongues as they collaborate with others.</p>
