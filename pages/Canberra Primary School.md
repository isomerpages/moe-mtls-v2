<h4 style="font-size: 35px;font-family: Lato,sans-serif;padding-top:12px;margin:10px;color: #fa0;text-align:justify;">Language Fun with eBook Creation</h4>
<p style="font-size: 20px;font-family: Lato,sans-serif;text-align:justify;">Through the “Language Fun with eBook Creation” activity, Canberra Primary School hopes to increase our pupils’ interest in learning Chinese Language, cultivate their ability to apply their language and ICT skills, and enhance their creativity and interaction skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Our lower primary pupils integrate their knowledge of Chinese Language, Art and ICT to create eBooks using sentence structures they have learnt during lessons. They also learn to use apps to create illustrations and audio recordings, to make their creation “come to life”.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
This activity not only brings joy to learning, but also helps to promote their language development. </p>
