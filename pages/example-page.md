<div style="text-align:justify;">The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) is an annual event co-organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC). It is an annual event that many children, parents, community partners and MTL educators look forward to. 

The theme of this year’s MTLS is “Flourish in the Wonderland of Our Languages,” and will be held on Saturday, 26 August 2023, at the Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre. The symposium will return to a full face-to-face format since the COVID-19 pandemic.
