<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:20px">This year's symposium will feature 42 physical exhibition booths from schools and community partners with fun and interactive activities. Children can look forward to taking part in the MTL challenge by participating in Mother Tongue Language activities at all of the exhibition booths to collect stamps and redeem prizes.<br><br>
There will also be the MOE Curriculum Booth, which will feature information from preschool to junior college. Visitors will learn about the progression in curricula and key programmes in the educational journey.<br><br> 
Exhibition boards will be uploaded to the website after the event.<br><br>
The centrepiece activities offer children opportunities to explore their Mother Tongue Languages by assisting the MTLS characters in their whimsical adventures through aural, speaking, and hands-on experiences at four stations: Xiao Tao's Farm, Sani's Castle, Kavin's Forest, and Peppy's Confectionery. </p><br><br>
